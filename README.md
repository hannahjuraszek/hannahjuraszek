# Hello!
I'm Hannah Juraszek. I'm a software engineer, primarily working in C# with some C++ and Java on the side.
I love video games, as any good nerd should, my dogs, and Stack Overflow (again, as any good nerd should).

# Interests
Call me crazy, but my favorite aspect of development is finding bugs and fixing them. Don't get me wrong,
I love designing new features and writing code as much as the next person, but there's something about
a tricky bug that really engulfs me. I'll find myself thinking about it as I'm trying to sleep. I pride
myself on my good understanding of code flow, which really comes in handy with debugging.

# Learning
I love learning about design patterns, up-and-coming technologies (.NET 5.0 I'm looking at you!), and
really anything and everything regarding coding standards and common practices.
